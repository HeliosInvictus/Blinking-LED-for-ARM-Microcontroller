# Blinking-LED-for-ARM-Microcontroller
The Micro-controller I used was a M-4 cortex  
For this project I programmed a general purpose timer on my microcontroller to blink with different onboard LEDs every second.
I generally make my own memory map so I can understand the process behind a library aswell as get more familiar with direct register access. This kind of programming can be justified with an increase of performance on critical devices.
